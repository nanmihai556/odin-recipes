        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Potato salad is a dish made from boiled potatoes and a variety of other ingredients. It is generally considered
            a side dish, as it usually accompanies the main course. Potato salad is widely believed to have originated in 
            Germany, spreading largely throughout Europe, European colonies and later Asia. American potato salad most
            likely originated from recipes brought to the U.S. by way of German and other European immigrants during the nineteenth
            century.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients needed:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 medium white potatoes or Yukon golds , about 2 1/2 to 3 pounds, skin on and quartered</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
            <li>2 celery stalks (ribs) , diced</li>
            <li>6 green onions , diced</li>
            <li>5 hard boiled eggs , peeled</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups Miracle Whip or mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon yellow mustard</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons celery seed</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>paprika for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the potatoes to a large pot of cold water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a lightly rolling boil over
                medium heat and add 1 teaspoon of kosher salt. Cook for 20-25 minutes or until the potatoes are easily pierced
                with a fork or paring knife. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Peel the skins from the potatoes and cut into 1/2" to 3/4" square pieces. Transfer the warm potatoes to a large
                mixing bowl and sprinkle with the white vinegar. Toss the potatoes with the vinegar and set the potatoes aside
                to cool, about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the celery and the green onions to the potato mixture. Chop 4 of the hard boiled eggs and add to the potato mixture.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix the Miracle Whip or mayonnaise, yellow mustard, celery seed and salt and pepper. Fold into
                 the potato mixture and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Slice the last egg into thin slices and place
                  the slices on top of the salad. Sprinkle with paprika if desired. Chill for at least 1 hour or overnight before serving.</li>
        </ol>
