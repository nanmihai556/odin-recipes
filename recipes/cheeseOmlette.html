        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a great quick meal at any time of the day. Eggs are a fantastic, affordable source of protein, helping our
           muscles to grow and repair and helping us to feel fuller for longer. Serve your omelette with wholemeal bread and
           a simple tomato salad for a healthy, balanced meal.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients needed:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large free-range eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
            <li>50g cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl, season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper,
                then beat well with a fork until fully combined.</li>
            <li>Place a small non-stick frying pan on a low heat to warm up.</li>
            <li>Grate the cheese onto a board and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add Â½ tablespoon of oil to the hot pan, then carefully pour in the eggs.</li>
            <li>Tilt the pan to spread them out evenly, using a fork to swirl the eggs around the pan a little.</li>
            <li>When the omelette begins to cook and firm up, but still has a little raw egg on top, sprinkle over the cheese.</li>
            <li>Using a spatula, ease around the edges of the omelette, then fold it over in half.</li>
            <li>When it starts to turn golden brown underneath, remove the pan from the heat and slide the omelette onto a plate.
                Delicious with a tomato salad and wholemeal bread.</li>
        </ol>
